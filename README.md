Every open source project has its own style guide.
It is a set of rules and about how to write the code for the project.
It's easy to understand when all the codes in a very large codebase are in a consistent style.

This project([pelagornis/styleguide](https://github.com/pelagornis/styleguide)) is a guideline that applies to all projects in Pelagornis.

StyleGuide uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), static site generator in Ruby.

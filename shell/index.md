## Shell

### Shell Style Rules

#### Shell Start

Executables must start with `#!/bin/bash` and a minimum number of flags

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

#### File Extensions

Executable files must not have an extension or a `.sh` extension; libraries must have a `.sh` extension and no executable files.

When you run a program, you do not need to know what language the program is written in, and you do not need an extension for the shell, so it is not recommended to use the extension for the executable file.

#### SUID/SGID

SUID and SGID are forbidden on shell scripts.

Use `sudo` to provide elevated access if you need it.

#### Error message classification

All error messages should go to `STDERR`.

```bash
err() {
  echo "[$(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z')]: $*" >&2
}

if ! do_something; then
  err "Unable to do_something"
  exit 1
fi
```

#### File Header Comment

Start each file with a description of its contents.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# Starting for Pelagornis Test Script.
```

#### Function Comments

Any features that are neither clear nor short should be annotated.

All function annotations should describe the intended API behavior using the following.


```bash
#######################################
# Create File for pelagornis Project.
# Globals:
#   SOMEDIR
# Arguments:
#   File Name
# Outputs:
#   Indicates whether the file creation was successful.
#######################################
function create_file() {
  â€¦
}
```

#### Meaningful Variable Names

Use uppercase letters for variable names and prefer underscores `_` for readability.

```bash
OUTPUT_DIR="/path/to/output"
FILE_NAME="example.txt"
```

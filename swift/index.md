### Naming

#### Appleâ€™s API Style Guidelines
Appleâ€™s [official Swift naming and API design guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) hosted on swift.org are considered part of this style guide and are followed as if they were repeated here in their entirety.

#### Identifiers
Typically, identifiers contain only 7-bit ASCII characters. Unicode identifiers have clear, legitimate meanings in the problem area of the code base (e.g., Greek characters representing mathematical concepts) and are acceptable if the team that owns the code understands them well.

```swift
/// Wrong
let ðŸ˜Ž = "ðŸ˜Ž"

/// Right
let nice = "ðŸ˜Ž"
```
#### Initializers
For clarity, the initializer argument that corresponds directly to the stored property has the same property and name. Use explicit `self.` to clearly distinguish between assignments.

```swift
/// Wrong
public struct Company {
    public let name: String
    public let location: String

    public init(name: String, location place: String) {
        name = name
        location = place
    }
}

/// Right
public struct Company {
    public let name: String
    public let location: String

    public init(name: String, location: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.location = location
    }
}
```

#### Static and Class Properties
Static and class properties that return instances of the declaring type are not suffixed with the name of the type.

```swift
/// Wrong
public class UIColor {
    public class var blackColor: UIColor {
        // ...
    }
}

/// Right
public class UIColor {
    public class var black: UIColor {
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Global Constants
Like other variables, the global constant is `lowerCamelCase`.

```swift
/// Wrong
let VERSION = "1.0.0"

/// Right
let version = "1.0.0"
```


### Swift Style Rules


### Swift Formatting Rules

#### Indentation
Indent by 2 spaces at a time.

When writing a colon (`:`), leave spaces only on the right side of the colon.
```swift
/// Wrong
let item:[Int:String]?

/// Right
let item: [Int: String]?
```

#### Maximum line length
Each line should have a maximum column width of 100 characters.
- Xcode's `Prefeneces` -> `Text Editing` -> `Display`  and set it to 100 characters.

#### Empty line
Make sure there are no spaces in the blank line, and all files must end in blank lines.
The MARK syntax requires spaces below.

```swift
/// Wrong
// MARK: Property
let name: String = ""

/// Right
// MARK: Property

let name: String = ""

```

#### Semicolons
Semicolons (;) are not used, either to terminate or separate statements.
```swift
/// Wrong
func run() {
    let company = "Pelagornis";
    print("Hello \(company)");
}

/// Right
func run() {
    let company = "Pelagornis";
    print("Hello \(company)")
}
```

#### Import
The module import is sorted alphabetically, import the built-in framework first, separated by blank lines, and import the third-party framework.

```swift
import UIKit

import Builder
import Snapkit
```

#### Comment
Use `///` to leave comments used for documentation.
```swift
/// Banner image exposed at the top of the main screen
final class BannerView: UIView {

  /// Image to float banner image View
    var bannerImageView: ImageView!
}
```

Use `// MARK:` to separate codes by type.
```swift
// MARK: Properties

let nameLabel: UILabel!
let dismissButton: UIButton!

// MARK: Initalizer

override init(frame: CGRect) {
  // ...
}

// MARK: Actions

override func dismissButtonDidTap() {
  // ...
}
```

### Patterns

#### Unwrapping
Prefer to initialize properties at init time, if possible, without using the force unwrapping option.

```swift
/// Wrong
final class Company: NSObject {

    var name: String!

    init() {
        super.init()
        name = "Pelagornis"
    }
}

/// Right
final class Company: NSObject {

    var name: String

    init() {
        name = ""
        super.init()
    }
}
```

#### Optional Binding
`guard else` is written on the same line if it does not impair readability or does not exceed 100 lines. </br>
And Prefer to use guard statements rather than if statements to minimize overlap.

#### Defer
Consider using `defer block` if you need a cleanup code at multiple end points.

#### Blank
Only one blank line is allowed

```swift
/// Wrong
func run() {
    let name = ""


    print(name)
}

/// Right
func run() {
    let name = ""

    print(name)
}
```

#### Spacing
Give a space around the curly brackets.

```swift
/// Wrong
value.filter{true}.map{$0}

/// Right
value.filter { true }.map { $0 }

```
